/**
 * <p>
 * A WriteAheadRepository is used to persist state that is otherwise kept
 * in-memory. The Repository does not provide any query capability except to
 * allow the data to be recovered upon restart of the system.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * A WriteAheadRepository operates by writing every update to an Edit Log. On
 * restart, the data can be recovered by replaying all of the updates that are
 * found in the Edit Log. This can, however, eventually result in very large
 * Edit Logs, which can both take up massive amounts of disk space and take a
 * long time to recover. In order to prevent this, the Repository provides a
 * Checkpointing capability. This allows the current in-memory state of the
 * Repository to be flushed to disk and the Edit Log to be deleted, thereby
 * compacting the amount of space required to store the Repository. After a
 * Checkpoint is performed, modifications are again written to an Edit Log. At
 * this point, when the system is to be restored, it is restored by first
 * loading the Checkpointed version of the Repository and then replaying the
 * Edit Log.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * All implementations of <code>WriteAheadRepository</code> use one or more
 * partitions to manage their Edit Logs. An implementation may require exactly
 * one partition or may allow many partitions.
 * </p>
