/**
 * <p>
 * A Revision Manager provides the ability to prevent clients of the Web API from
 * stepping on one another. This is done by providing claims and locking mechanisms
 * for components individually.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Clients that will modify a resource must do so using a two-phase commit. First,
 * the client will issue a request that includes an HTTP Header of "X-NcmExpects".
 * This indicates that the request will not actually be performed but rather that the
 * node should validate that the request could in fact be performed. If all nodes respond
 * with a 150-Continue response, then the second phase will commence. The second phase
 * will consist of replicating the same request but without the "X-NcmExpects" header.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * When the first phase of the two-phase commit is processed, the Revision Manager should
 * be used to obtain a Revision Claim by calling the {@link #requestClaim(Collection)}
 * method. If a Claim is granted, then the request validation may continue. If the
 * Claim is not granted, the request should fail and the second phase should not
 * be performed.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * If the first phase of the above two-phase commit completes and all nodes indicate that the
 * request may continue, this means that all nodes have provided granted a Claim on the Revisions
 * that are relevant. This Claim will automatically expire after some time. This expiration
 * means that if the node that issues the first phase never initiates the second phase (if the node
 * dies or loses network connectivitiy, for instance), then the Revision Claim will expire and
 * the Revision will remain unchanged.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * When the second phase begins, changes to the resource(s) must be made with the Revisions
 * locked. This is accomplished by wrapping the logic in a {@link Runnable} and passing the Runnable,
 * along with the {@link RevisionClaim} to the {@link #updateRevision(RevisionClaim, Supplier)} method.
 * </p>
