<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
    This processor polls a SNMP agent to get information for a given OID (Strategy = GET) or for all the sub-tree associated to a given OID
    (Strategy = WALK). This processors supports SNMPv1, SNMPv2c and SNMPv3. The component is based on <a href="http://www.snmp4j.org/">SNMP4J</a>.
</p>
<p>
    When the processor is triggered, it sends the SNMP request and gets the information associated to request OID(s). Once response is received
    from the SNMP agent, a FlowFile is constructed. The FlowFile content is empty, all the information is written in the FlowFile attributes.
    In case of a single GET request, the properties associated to the received PDU are transferred into the FlowFile as attributes. In case of a
    WALK request, only the couples "OID/value" are transferred into the FlowFile as attributes. SNMP attributes names are prefixed with
    <i>snmp$</i> prefix.
</p>
<p>
    Regarding the attributes representing the couples "OID/value", the attribute name has the following format:
    <ul><li>snmp$<i>OID</i>$<i>SMI_Syntax_Value</i></li></ul>
    where OID is the request OID, and SMI_Syntax_Value is the integer representing the type of the value associated to the OID. This value is
    provided to allow the SetSNMP processor setting values in the correct type.
</p>
<h2>SNMP Properties</h2>
<p>
    In case of a single SNMP Get request, the following is the list of available standard SNMP properties which may come with the PDU:
    <i>("snmp$errorIndex", "snmp$errorStatus", "snmp$errorStatusText", "snmp$nonRepeaters", "snmp$requestID", "snmp$type")</i>
</p>
<h2>Configuration Details</h2>
<p>
    At the time of writing this document it only defines the essential configuration properties which are suitable for most cases. 
    Other properties will be defined later as this component progresses.
    Configuring GetSNMP:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Host</b> - [REQUIRED] the name of the host where the SNMP agent is running. (default is localhost)</li>
    <li><b>Port</b> - [REQUIRED] the port number on which the SNMP agent is listening. (default is 161)</li>
    <li><b>OID</b> - [REQUIRED] the root OID to request.</li>
    <li><b>Version</b> - [REQUIRED] the SNMP version to use (SNMPv1 [default], or SNMPv2c, or SNMPv3)</li>
    <li><b>Community</b> - [REQUIRED if SNMPv1 or SNMPv2c] the SNMP community to use. (default is public)</li>
    <li><b>Security Level</b> - [REQUIRED if SNMPv3] the security level to use. (default is authPriv)</li>
    <li><b>Security Name</b> - [REQUIRED if SNMPv3] the security name (user name) to use.</li>
    <li><b>Authentication Protocol</b> - [REQUIRED if SNMPv3 and authNoPriv or authPriv] the authentication protocol to use.</li>
    <li><b>Authentication Password</b> - [REQUIRED if SNMPv3 and authNoPriv or authPriv] the authentication password to use.</li>
    <li><b>Private Protocol</b> - [REQUIRED if SNMPv3 and authPriv] the private protocol to use.</li>
    <li><b>Private Password</b> - [REQUIRED if SNMPv3 and authPriv] the private password to use.</li>
    <li><b>Retries</b> - [REQUIRED] Sets the number of retries to be performed before a request is timed out. (default is 0)</li>
    <li><b>Timeout</b> - [REQUIRED] Sets  timeout in milliseconds before a confirmed request is resent or timed out. (default is 5000)</li>
</ul>
