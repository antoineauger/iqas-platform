<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
    This processor sends SNMP set requests to a SNMP agent in order to update information associated to a given OID. This processor supports 
    SNMPv1, SNMPv2c and SNMPv3. The component is based on <a href="http://www.snmp4j.org/">SNMP4J</a>.
</p>
<p>
    The processor constructs SNMP Set requests by extracting information from FlowFile attributes. The processor is looking for attributes
    prefixed with <i>snmp$</i>. If such an attribute is found, the attribute name is split using the $ character. The second element must
    respect the OID format to be considered as a valid OID. If there is a third element, it must represents the SMI Syntax integer value of
    the type of data associated to the given OID to allow a correct conversion. If there is no third element, the value is considered as a String
    and the value will be sent as an OctetString object.
</p>
