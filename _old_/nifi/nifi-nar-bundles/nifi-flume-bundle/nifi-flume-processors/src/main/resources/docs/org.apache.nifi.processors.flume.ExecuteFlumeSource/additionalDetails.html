<h2>Data Model</h2>
<p>
    This processor executes an Apache Flume source. Each Flume Event is turned into
    a FlowFile. The content of the FlowFile is set to the body of the Event and
    the Event headers become FlowFile attributes.
</p>
<h2>Configuration Details</h2>
<p>
    This processor is designed to execute arbitrary Flume sources. Most of the details
    of configuring the source is deferred to Flume's built-in configuration system.
    For details on the available settings for each source type, refer to the Flume
    <a href="http://flume.apache.org/FlumeUserGuide.html#flume-sources">User Guide</a>.
    Configuring the Flume source is a four step process:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Set the Source Type property to a valid Flume source type.</li>
    <li>
        Set the Agent Name property to the name of the agent in your
        Flume configuration. This is the prefix of the properties in the Flume
        configuration file. Example: <code>tier1</code>
    </li>
    <li>
        Set the Source Name property to the name of the source in your Flume
        configuration. If Agent Name is <code>tier1</code>, then the Source Name
        is the value of the <code>tier1.sources</code> property. Example: <code>src-1</code>
    </li>
    <li>
        Copy and paste the configuration for the source from your Flume configuration
        file into the Flume Configuration property. Assuming you're using
        the same Agent Name and Source Name as in the examples above, this will be all
        of the properties that start with <code>tier1.sources.src-1</code>.
        Do not copy the <code>tier1.sources.src-1.type</code> or
        <code>tier1.sources.src-1.channel</code> properties.
    </li>
</ol>
<h2>Usage Example</h2>
<p>
    Assuming you had the following existing Flume configuration file:
</p>
    <pre>
a1.sources = r1
a1.sinks = k1
a1.channels = c1

a1.sources.r1.type = multiport_syslogtcp
a1.sources.r1.channels = c1
a1.sources.r1.host = 0.0.0.0
a1.sources.r1.ports = 10001 10002 10003
a1.sources.r1.portHeader = port

a1.sinks.k1.type = logger

a1.channels.c1.type = memory
a1.channels.c1.capacity = 1000
a1.channels.c1.transactionCapacity = 100

a1.sources.r1.channels = c1
a1.sinks.k1.channel = c1</pre>
<p>
    Then you'd configure the ExecuteFlumeSource as follows:
</p>
<table id="example">
    <tr>
        <th>Property</th>
        <th>Value</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Source Type</td>
        <td>multiport_syslogtcp</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Agent Name</td>
        <td>a1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Source Name</td>
        <td>r1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Flume Configuration</td>
        <td>
            <code>
                a1.sources.r1.host = 0.0.0.0<br>
                a1.sources.r1.ports = 10001 10002 10003<br>
                a1.sources.r1.portHeader = port
            </code>
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>
