/**
 * <p>
 * A Revision Manager provides the ability to prevent clients of the Web API from
 * stepping on one another. This is done by providing revisions
 * for components individually.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Clients that will modify a resource must do so using a two-phase commit. First,
 * the client will issue a request that includes an HTTP Header of "X-NcmExpects".
 * This indicates that the request will not actually be performed but rather that the
 * node should validate that the request could in fact be performed. If all nodes respond
 * with a 150-Continue response, then the second phase will commence. The second phase
 * will consist of replicating the same request but without the "X-NcmExpects" header.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * When the first phase of the two-phase commit is processed, the Revision Manager should
 * be used to verify that the client-provided Revisions are current by calling the
 * {@link #verifyRevisions(Collection)}
 * method. If the revisions are up-to-date, the method will return successfully and the
 * request validation may continue. Otherwise, the request should fail and the second phase
 * should not be performed.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * If the first phase of the above two-phase commit completes and all nodes indicate that the
 * request may continue, this means that all nodes have agreed that the client's Revisions are
 * acceptable.
 * </p>
