Implementation

+++ Virtual Sensors +++
-Add hazard events
-Improve obs generation (real/adapted timestamp)

+++ iQAS platform +++
-Class for Symptoms > Plans
-Class for Executions (according to the MAPE-K loop RD / Info)
-Define RFC for each MAPE-K loop
-Notification Service (actor)
-iQAS monitoring service (pour MAPE-K, Kafka and cluster metrics only)
-Add Knowledge layer

+++ Consumers +++
-Real-time consuming (graph, pie charts?)

Evaluation

-Duration of service interruption in case of a sensor failure and available candidate
-Number of satisfied requests
-Number of obs/sec delivered
-Number of obs/s processed
-Sensor battery with/without specific adaptation strategies
-obs latency (mean/max/min/std)
-Time to take into account new symptom, remedy (if class loader)
